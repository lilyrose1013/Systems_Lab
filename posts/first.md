<img src="/_assets/MarmPillow.png" alt="Marmalade on pillow" style="display: block; margin: 10px auto; max-width: 400px;">

<p style="text-align: center;">I was on the search for a cat after I was in a car crash, as a way to support me through the hard times. <br> 
I had always wanted a cat, as they where my favorite animals, and my grandma Had a cat who when I would visit would be cutest little thing <br> I was on facebook and I saw a family who was getting rid of there family cat<br>
So I viewed it as a sign from the universe  </p>


<h2 style="text-align: center;">I RAN TO PICK HIM UP !!!!!</h3>


<p style="text-align: center;">  At the time he was 1 year and 6 months old <br> HE was A BIG BOY!!! but also very nervous you could tell he was anxious<br> 
the whole car ride back to my house he hid by my feet or in the blanket I had brought with me <br>
The whole night that night he slept in my bed hiding in the gap between me and the wall.
